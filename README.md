### Securing a Web Application
This module creates a simple web application with resources that are protected by Spring Security. We build a Spring MVC application that secures the page with a login form that is backed by a fixed list of users.

> #### Implementation Notes
>  If Spring Security is on the classpath, Spring Boot automatically secures all HTTP endpoints with “basic” authentication. However, you can further customize the security settings.
